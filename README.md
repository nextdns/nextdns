# NextDNS CLI Client

NextDNS CLI is a DNS53 to DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) proxy with advanced capabilities to get the most out of the [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io) service. Although the most advanced features will only work with NextDNS, this program can work as a client for any DoH provider or a mix of NextDNS + another DNS (split horizon).

The CLI is mostly aimed at routers and UNIX based systems, but it is also a great client for windows and macOS for people who prefer a fully open-source clients and don't mind the lack of GUI.

See [the wiki](https://github.com/nextdns/nextdns/wiki) for installation and usage instructions.
