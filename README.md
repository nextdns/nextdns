# NextDNS CLI Client

NextDNS CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to use [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io)'s DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) service with advanced capabilities. Although the most advanced features will only work with NextDNS, this program can work as a client for any DoH provider or a mix of NextDNS + another DNS (split horizon).

This CLI is mostly aimed at routers and UNIX based systems, but it is also a great client for Windows and macOS, especially for people who prefer a fully open-source client and don't mind the lack of a GUI.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/nextdns/nextdns/wiki) for installation and usage instructions.
